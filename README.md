# seven-day-averages
I used [New York Times repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) of live, cumulative COVID data to calculate new daily cases, create a 7-day average, and compare this weekâ€™s average to the previous week.

The code for this problem uses the Python requests library to access the New York Times data stored in an accessible GitHub repository. This is stored as a CSV file. The program then uses DictReader to read the CSV file. It then creates a States list to use selected States for calculations.
